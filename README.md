*******************************The VIDIVOX Project*********************************

Welcome to Vidivox. You can run this from the main Linux environment (l) in the
UG4 labs. In order to run this, you will have to give it permission. This can be 
done by right clicking on VIDIVOX_szaf045.jar, clicking on properties, and in the
permissions tab, ticking the box that gives it permission to run.

->You should be able to then double-click on the jar to run it.

->You can also run Vidivox from the command line by navigating to the directory 
   with the jar in it and typing this command: java -jar VIDIVOX_szaf045.jar

Upon the execution of the program, two folders called ".PetulantWaffle" and 
"PWNewFiles" will be created. This should be created in your home directory, but
if you can't find it there for some reason, it should be in your current directory.

In order for the Help funtion to work, the "UserManual.pdf" file will need to be in
the same directory as the two files that are created.

Please make sure you have Festival and FFMPEG installed for optimum usage of Vidivox
features.

Hope you enjoy using my Vidivox!
